## Features

<CardGrid>
	<Card title="Devnet via Viem transport" icon="pencil">
		Plugs a local EVM devnet akin to [anvil](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/tree/master/crates/anvil) directly into your [viem client via a custom transport](https://viem.sh/docs/clients/intro.html). This unlocks capabilities in the browser previously reserved for serverside code.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Powerful testing devnet" icon="open-book">
		Tevm can be used as a powerful testing devnet for JavaScript with anvil and hardhat compatability.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Solidity compiler" icon="setting">
		[Import solidity files](/learn/solidity-imports) directly into TypeScript. No need to set up complicated build pipelines just import the solidity file like it's any other module `import {MyContract} from './path/to/my/Contract.sol`
	</Card>
	<Card title="Solidity scripting" icon="add-document">
		A powerful [solidity scripting](/learn/scripting) support akin to [foundry scripts](https://book.getfoundry.sh/tutorials/solidity-scripting). 
	</Card>
