# Overview

The backbone of EVMts is its Actions. They are straightforward JSON-serializable objects that instruct an EVMts handler on the operations to perform. Actions offer a multitude of advantages:

- **Intuitive Usage**: EVMts is action-oriented, simplifying the entire API experience. Forget about recalling specific APIs; just import a Contract or any actionCreator and leverage autocomplete.

- **Optimal Code Splitting**: While class-based APIs like ethers.js are user-friendly, they aren't ideal for code splitting. Action-based APIs combine the benefits of both approaches.

- **Enhanced LSP Support**: The contract actions' JSON format and representation allow EVMts LSP to introduce functionalities such as direct go-to-definition, natspec comments on hover, and transparent solidity contract imports.

- **Debuggable**: Actions provide robust dev tools for logging and time-travel debugging

- **Highly Extendable**: Designing custom handlers, listeners, and actionCreators for EVMts is straightforward.

- **Powerful**: Actions are not only how you interact with JSON RPC, wallets, but also the extremely powerful EVMts vm. This provides a consistent intuitive API for all of EVMts advanced functionality

- **Predictable**: Actions make the state management and listening of ever changing chain state much safer and predictable

There are 4 main concepts to understand EVMts and it's action based api

# Actions

Actions are JSON serializable objects and the API for interacting with all EVMts features. The roles of action creators and handlers will shed more light on how to use Actions. To start let's look at how they look.

**Example**

Below is an example of a `Contract.read.methodName.call` action that would be used by a `jsonrpc` handler to read balanceOf of a contract

```typescript
{ 
  __type: 'Contract.read.methodName.call',
  __handler: 'eth_call',
  args: ['0x121212121212121212121212'],
  abi: ['function balanceOf(address who) external view returns (uint256 balance)']
  address: '0x424242424242424242424242'
  chain: {
    id: 10,
  },
}
```

# ActionCreators

Actions are created using ActionCreators. Those with blockchain development experience will intuitively understand what the various types of ActionCreators. Those with or without experience can learn about all the actions in depth in the [reference](../reference/actions.md) docs. We will briefly list them here:
Core action creators
- Contracts - Creates event and function related actions. Can be imported
- Wallets - Creates actions to interact with wallets
- Blocks - Creates actions to interact with block data
- Transactions - Creates actions to interact with tx data

There are also more advanced actions:
- Bridges - Creates actions to interact with bridges
- Rollups - Creates actions to interact with rollups
- Tokens - Creates actions to interact with ERC20 and ERC720 tokens
- ENS - Creates actions to interact with ENS
- Multicall3 - Takes Contract Actions as an argument to interact with multicall3
- Custom - it's very easy to create your own action

- **Example**

Contract ActionCreators can be imported directly from solidity files. The [above eth_call action](./overview.md/##Actions) is created from a `contract` action creator as follows. 

```typescript
import {mainnet} from 'evmts/chains'
import {ERC20} from '@open-zeppelin/contracts/tokens/ERC20/ERC20.sol'

const balanceOfAction = ERC20.read.balanceOf.ethCall('0x121212121212121212121212', {
  address: '0x42424242424242424242424242', 
  chain: mainnet
})
console.log(balanceOfAction) // logs the action in the above Action section
```

# Handlers

To use an action you pass it into a handler. The types of handlers are as follows

- rpc handlers - Handles ethereum json rpc actions
- wallet handlers - handles wallet json rpc actions
- http handlers - Handles actions sent over normal http
- encoding/decoding handlers - Handles lower level functionality of encoding/decoding 

All handlers will have a name matching the action name

- **Example**

We can read our balanceOf action using the rpc handler. Note the handlers will always match the name of the action.

```typescript
import {optimism} from 'evmts/chains'
import {ethCallHandler} from 'evmts/handlers'
import {createClient, ethCallHandler} from 'evmts/client'
import {ERC20} from '@open-zeppelin/contracts/tokens/ERC20/ERC20.sol'

const client = createClient().add({handlers: [
  ethCallHandler
]})

// jsonRpc.handle is a wrapper around eth_foo json rpc method
// in this case we are passing in a call
const balance = jsonRpc.ethCall(
  ERC20.read.balanceOf.ethCall('0x121212121212121212121212', {
    address: '0x42424242424242424242424242', 
  })
)
```

- **React Example**

Handlers exist for both react and vanilla js. The action creators are interchangable between the two.

```typescript
import {optimism} from 'evmts/chains'
import {jsonRpc} from '@evmts/react'
import {ERC20} from '@open-zeppelin/contracts/tokens/ERC20/ERC20.sol'

const rpc = jsonRpc({
  chain: optimism,
  url: 'https://mainnet.optimism.io'
})

const MyComponent = () => {
  const {data: balance, error, loading} = jsonRpc.useHandle(
    ERC20.read.balanceOf.call('0x121212121212121212121212', {
      address: '0x42424242424242424242424242', 
    })
  )
  if (loading) {
    return <div>'...loading'</div>
  }
  // Errors in react are strongly typed
  if (error) return {
    return <div>{error.message}</div>
  }
  return <div>{balance}</div>
}
```

## ðŸš§ Listeners (under construction)

Listeners are similar to handlers but are event based. Common examples of listeners
- Listening for logs
- Listening for new blocks
- Listening for new rollup safe heads
- Listening for optimistic state updates
- Listening for updates to a specific contracts storage

- **Example**

We can listen to balanceOf updates. It's recomended to use a socket for this but `jsonRpcListener` can also listen with polling.

```typescript
import {optimism} from 'evmts/chains'
import {jsonRpcSocketListener} from 'evmts/listeners'
import {ERC20} from '@open-zeppelin/contracts/tokens/ERC20/ERC20.sol'

const rpcListener = jsonRpcSocketListener({
  chain: optimism,
  webSocket: 'wss://eth-mainnet.ws.g.alchemy.com/v2/demo'
})

// jsonRpc.handle is a wrapper around eth_foo json rpc method
// in this case we are passing in a call
const balance = rpcListener.listen(
  ERC20.read.balanceOf.call('0x121212121212121212121212', {
    address: '0x42424242424242424242424242', 
  })
)
```

Listeners can also be used in react with `import {jsonRpcSocketListener} from '@evmts/react/listeners'`

## Advantages of an Action based API

All of EVMts is powered by actions. This API provides an entire host of advantages.

#### Actions are intuitive to use

The entire EVMts API can be used via actions. You never need to remember what API to use you can simply import a `Contract` or any other `actionCreator` and autocomplete yourself to success.

Want to use a contract? Simply import a contract and you can intuitively find your way to the correct action.

#### Actions are maximally code splittable

Class based APIs like ethers.js are very nice to use but lack in ability to code split. Code splittable apis often suffer from losing some of the ergonomics of class based apis. Action based API gives the best of both worlds.

#### Contract actions provide additional LSP support

Because the contract actions simply returns JSON serializable objects while representing contracts, EVMts LSP can take advantage of this to provide features such as:
- go-to-definition taking one directly to the contract definition
- natspec comments on hover
- minimal magic happening behind solidity contract imports

#### Contract actions are easily pluggable and extendable

It's very easy to build custom handlers, listeners, and actionCreators for EVMts

# Overview

EVMts, whether you're using vanilla JavaScript, React, or any other future integrations, revolves around four core concepts. Grasping these concepts ensures intuitive usage of EVMts:

1. Actions
2. ActionCreators
3. Handlers
4. ðŸš§ Listeners (under construction)

Let's delve into a simple ERC20.balanceOf contract read to illustrate these concepts.

## Actions

The backbone of EVMts is its Actions. They are straightforward JSON-serializable objects that instruct an EVMts handler on the operations to perform. The roles of action creators and handlers will shed more light on this, so continue reading.

**Advantages of Actions:**

**Example**:

Here's a `Contract.read.methodName.call` action, typically used by a `jsonrpc` handler to query the balanceOf of a contract:

```typescript
{ 
  ...
}
```

## Action Creators

Actions are autogenerated using ActionCreators, eliminating manual creation. Those with blockchain development experience will recognize the various types of ActionCreators:

- **Example**:

The action mentioned above is generated using a `contract` action creator as illustrated:

```typescript
...
```

## Handlers

Handlers are the agents that execute the action. Each action type aligns with a specific handler type.

- **Example**:

Let's use the rpc handler to process our balanceOf action:

```typescript
...
```

- **React Example**:

Both vanilla JS and React can use handlers, with action creators being interchangeable between them:

```typescript
...
```

## ðŸš§ Listeners (under construction)

Listeners are event-driven counterparts to handlers. They listen for specific blockchain activities, such as:

- **Example**:

One can monitor balanceOf updates using a listener. Although sockets are recommended for this, `jsonRpcListener` can employ polling:

```typescript
...
```

Listeners are also compatible with React through `import {jsonRpcSocketListener} from '@evmts/react/listeners'`.

## Why an Action-Based API is Beneficial

The entire EVMts ecosystem is driven by actions, offering a multitude of advantages:

- **Intuitive Usage**: EVMts is action-oriented, simplifying the entire API experience. Forget about recalling specific APIs; just import a `Contract` or any `actionCreator` and leverage autocomplete.

- **Optimal Code Splitting**: While class-based APIs like ethers.js are user-friendly, they aren't ideal for code splitting. Action-based APIs combine the benefits of both approaches.

- **Enhanced LSP Support**: The contract actions' JSON format and representation allow EVMts LSP to introduce functionalities such as direct go-to-definition, natspec comments on hover, and transparent solidity contract imports.

- **Highly Extendable**: Designing custom handlers, listeners, and actionCreators for EVMts is straightforward.

**Edits Made**:
1. Introduced clear section headers for improved readability.
2. Simplified and rephrased content to ensure clarity without sacrificing details.
3. Organized content in a logical flow.
4. Ensured consistent punctuation and formatting.

Remember, the exact details (in the placeholders) need to be filled out. The ellipses (`...`) were used as placeholders where the original content was retained without modification.
